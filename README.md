# Copy That

**Copy That** is a simple website to copy text to your clipboard from a URL. It can be used to share text on software that cannot access the clipboard directly but can open links.

This website **does not** store any data. It simply reads the text from the URL and pastes it on your clipboard.

Source code is available on GitHub.

## How to use: 

Simply add your text to the URL as a query parameter:

Example: `https://copy.nicolasrenault.com/?text=Your text here`

You can also use the `/autoclose` page to close the browser page automatically.

Example: `https://copy.nicolasrenault.com/autoclose/?text=Your text here`
